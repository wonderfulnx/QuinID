This repository contains the open-source content for our MobiCom'25 paper, "QuinID: Enabling FDMA-Based Fully Parallel RFID with Frequency-Selective Antenna." QuinID is the first frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) RFID system to achieve fully parallel reading.

In addition to the content here, we also provide â€” and strongly recommend â€” our high-performance UHF Gen2 RFID Reader implementation: [UHF-Gen2-RFID-Reader](https://github.com/wonderfulnx/UHF-Gen2-RFID-Reader). As far as we know, this is the highest-performance SDR-based UHF Gen2 RFID Reader available. It forms part of our QuinReader and runs on an ADI FMCOMMS2/3 + Zedboard FPGA platform, reaching the maximum BLF supported by the standard and achieving up to 1000 reads per second.

PS: The open source files will be uploaded soon. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to nudge me about its release.
